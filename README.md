<h2>Overview</h2>
<p1>This repository contains Excel templates and solutions I've developed over the years. As a small business owner myself, I understand the challenges of running a business efficiently. These templates are designed to help streamline workflows, reduce bottlenecks, and improve productivity.

Feel free to download and use them as needed—I hope they bring value to you and your business! </p1>

<h2>Reconciliation Templates</h2>
<p1>With a background in Accounting, I’ve always enjoyed calculating adjusting journal entries—though my peers didn’t quite share the same enthusiasm. Recognizing the need to simplify the month-end adjusting journal entry process, I created these templates to make calculations and uploads more efficient.

These templates are designed to take payment and accounting reports from merchant providers and accounting platforms, then aggregate the data into easy-to-read daily summaries of gross revenues and expenses.</p1>

<h3>Amazon Marketplace (Standard & Invoiced) Reconciliation Template</h3>
<p1>Download the report Amazon transaction export and copy-paste onto the "Paste transaction export here" tab. Columns F-H in the "Reconciliation Template" tab contains the daily summaries of the gross revenues and expenses that you can upload onto your accounting platform.</p1>
<h3>Amazon Pay Reconciliation Template</h3>
<p1>Amazon Pay and Amazon Marketplace have slight differences in reporting which is why there is a separate template for Amazon Pay. The instructions on using this template is the same as the instructions in the Amazon Marketplace template.</p1>
<h3>eBay Reconciliation Template</h3>
<p1>Download the eBay report and copy-paste onto the "eBay Report" tab. Columns F-H in the output tab contains the daily summaries of gross revenues and expenses that you can upload onto your accounting platform.</p1>

<h2>Data Migration</h2>
<h3>Quickbooks Data Migration Template</h3>
<p1>QuickBooks has long been the most widely used accounting platform. However, in recent years, more software and tech companies have introduced newer features tailored to today’s business needs. As a result, many businesses are transitioning away from QuickBooks to alternative platforms.

To simplify the data migration process, I created this template. It allows you to take your QuickBooks general ledger and the chart of accounts from your new platform, then automatically generates a file for upload. This way, you can transfer all your historical financial data with a simple copy-paste method—eliminating the need for hours of manual data entry.</p1>
